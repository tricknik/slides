# Some Economic Quick Facts.

- "For - though no one will believe it, economics is a technical and difficult subject."
  -- John Maynard Keynes, The Great Slump of 1930.

- The government does not spend tax money
- Without deficits savings are impossible
- US consumers are drowning in debt because the trade deficit is too big (well, somewhat)
- The economy is Greece is collapsing because the government deficit is too small (really!)
- Monetary Sovereignty is important

# The government does not spend tax money

- "Government fiat money necessarily means that federal spending need not be based on revenue. The federal government has no more money at its disposal when the federal budget is in surplus, than when the budget is in deficit." -- Waren Mosler, Soft Currency Economics

- All currency enters the private sector as government spending, and exists the private sector as taxes.


# Without deficits savings are impossible

- If the government taxes away all the money it spends, no extra money enters circulation, thus no savings or economic growth is possible.
- If the government runs a surplus, then this means that it's removing wealth from the private sector.
- "These budget deficits have added financial assets to the private sector, providing the demand for goods and services that have allowed us to maintain income growth. And that income growth has allowed us to save and accumulate financial assets at a far greater rate than we would have been able to without the deficits." -- Bill Mitchell, Debt, Deficit and Modern Monetary Theory.


# But OMG! Inflation! OMG!!!!  HYPERINFLATION!! OMFG!!

- Yes, Virginia, government spending can cause inflation.
- This is true whether the government is in surplus or deficit.
- Because government spending adds demand, and demand *might* drive prices up.
- Buy only when supply can't keep up.
- The Public Sector can only be balanced, when the private and external sectors are also balanced.

# Sectoral Balances

- Sectoral Balances <-- This is, like, really important!
- Public Sector, Private Sector, External Sector
- "When a sector, in aggregate, spends more than its income, it is said to be in deficit. If it spends less than its income, it is in surplus. [...] the deficit of the government sector plus the deficit of the domestic private sector plus the deficit of the external sector must sum to zero, balancing each other out [...] whatever the net positions of two sectors, the other sector must offset them exactly." Peter Cooper, Sectoral Balances and Keynesian Causation

# Trade Imbalances

- The massive US deficit requires a private sector surplus to finance it
- Imports don't create income for households
- Of course, this could be mitigated by public deficit
- But governments are more interested in bailing out banks, then households.
- Thus the surplus is created in the reserves of banks
- Banks lend to households, creating debt

# A Tale Of Two Countries

- So, the sectoral balances *must* always sum to zero.
- Let's look at Germany and Greece
- Germany has a trade surplus. Thus, it must either run a budgetary surplus, or allow the private sector to save more. Potentially leading to increased imports.. or *gasp* Inflation.
- Whenever one country has a trade surplus, another *must* have a trade deficit.
- Greece (*surprise, surprise*) has trade deficit, thus it *must* either run a budgetary deficit or allow private wealth to shrink. And shrink. And shrink. Until there is no demand for imports anymore because the economy has collapsed.


# The economy is Greece is collapsing because the government deficit is too small (It's True!)

- Greece and Germany do not have their own money, there can be no monetary policy that would work for both of them.
- Germany wants a tight monetary policy.
- Greece wants a loose monetary policy.
- Neither is right or wrong, but are required by their sectoral balances
- Because Greece does not have monetary sovereignty, it's debt is inevitable a burden

# Monetary Sovereignty is important

- Without monetary sovereignty a country does not have the policy options required to manage the sectoral balances.
- Public Debt is a Public Good, like roads or schools.

# Political Objectives

- Remove obstacles to public deficit
- Do not allow a lack of public deficit to create financial scarcity and private debt.
- Protect public goods that remove debt pressure; i.e. socialized education, housing, childcare, pensions, unemployment benefits, etc.
- Within the private sector, fight against the burden of debt being pushed down the income scale. Benefits not bailouts!
- Promote trade balance.
