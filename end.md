# "Communism" 

 - "Communism" Does not refer to the form of government of historical or contemporary "Communist" States. 
 - Communism is a theoretical society with no classes and no state.

# "Communism"
 - The term originates in the British and French collectivist/co-operative communities, such as the followers of Robert Owen.

# "Communism"

 - Democracy and equality must be respected in all human relations, not only in government, but also in economic and domestic life as well.

# "Capitalism" 

 - Capitalism does not refer to "The Free Market," "Enterprise," "Business," "Entrepreneurship" or "Liberal Democracy."
 - Capitalism refers to a society in which the owners of Capital are able to abstain from direct-production by appropriating the products of workers who employ their property in production. 

# "Capitalism"

 - The term originates among the Ricardian Socialists, early critics of Political Economy, and was intended to draw a correlation with Feudalism.

# "Capitalism"

 - "Labour Defended", Thomas Hodgskin, 1825
 - The law-giver and the capitalist always compare our wages with the wages of other labourers; and without adverting to what we produce, which seems the only criterion by which we ought to be paid, we are instantly condemned as insolent and ungrateful if we ask for more than was enjoyed by the slave of former times, and is now enjoyed by the half-starved slave of other countries

# Relations and Interconnections

 - Both Economies and Networks are composed of relations
 - Relations in a Network define the "Topology"
 - Relations in an Economy define the "Mode of Production"

# Mesh Networks

 - All participants can interact
 - No mediation
 - Authorization is based on mutual configuration
 - Each participant is autonomous

# Star Networks

 - All participants connect with the Operator
 - All interaction between participants is mediated
 - Authorization is granted by the operator
 - Each participant is dependent on the Operator

# Communism

 - All participants produce as equals
 - Producers retain everything they produce
 - Participants produce for social value
 - Exchange is based on mutual respect

# Capitalism

 - Participants divided into classes
 - Property owners appropriate wealth from producers
 - Participants produce for exchange value
 - Exchange is based on market price
 - Money earns more money

# Capitalists Love Star Networks

 - The Capitalist is the Operator
 - Roles and credentials create classes
 - Mediation is needed to charge a price

# Capitalists Hate Mesh Networks

 - Participants can interact directly
 - No Toll Gate, No Prices
 - No Privilege, No Control

# Capitalists Hate Mesh Networks

 - Capitalists must capture profit or lose their capital
 - Profit-seeking platforms must capture profit or vanish
 
# The Internet

 - Was not created by Capitalists
 - It was developed by Universities, NGOs, Hobbyists and the Military

# The Information Superhighway

 - Capitalists created "Online Services."
 - CompuServ, AOL, Prodigy, etc.
 - Until the nineties, major corporations had no real Internet strategy.

# Mediation

 - Capitalist "Online Services" where client-server systems, which employ a Star Topology.
 - The Internet was host to numerous Peer to Peer systems, such as Email, Usenet, IRC, which depend on a Mesh Topology. 
 
# Explosive Growth

 - Because the Internet is a peer system, anybody with a connection to it, could also connect others.
 - This created a boom of Internet Service Providers
 - This caught Capitalists by surprise

# Network Value

 - The exchange value these ISPs where capturing was collectively created.
 - The value of a network comes from the size of the network

# Communism Loves A Mesh Network

 - Each ISP was independently earning income by being a part of a common platform, not owned by anybody as a whole, but composed of the mutual interconnections of the participants.
 - This does not resemble a Market Economy, but rather a Network Economy.

# Communism Loves A Mesh Network

 - Developers work for ISPs, Universities, and NGOs
 - Students and Hobbyists
 - Regular users also adopted a culture of sharing
 
# Communism Loves A Mesh Network

 - The::Cyber.Com/munist::Manifesto by Richard Barbrook
 - "Within the Net, people are developing the most advanced form of collective labour: work-as-gift."

# Capitalism Hates Competition

 - Arthur Twining Hadley, 1885.
 - "Railroad competition may exist everywhere, somewhere or nowhere. If it exists everywhere, rates are reduced to the level of movement charges [variable costs], and there is nothing to pay fixed charges"

# Capitalism Hates Competition

 - A competative railway network cannot afford Capital ("fixed charges");
 - At This time, J.P. Morgan was waging a war against "Destructive Competition" to consolidate the railways.

# Enclosure 1.0: Capture Infrastructure

 - Capitalists where not happy about the Internet.
 - The Capitalists bought everything they could
 - dotCom boom

# Consolidation

 - If you had internet access in the mid-90s it was from
a mom & pop ISP with a shelf full of consumer grade modems.
 - Today, access is mostly provided by giant telecommunications conglomerates.

# Enclosure 2.0: The Return of Client-Server

 - Communism must be driven from the Network
 - Web 2.0
 - The Web is a Client-Server platform

# The Imposition of a Star Topology

 - Usenet, Email, IRC, Finger, etc is replaced by
   centralized social media platforms
 - Facebook, Twitter, etc

# The Imposition of a Star Topology

 - The Business model of social media monopolies is
survieallance and behavioural control
 - Free and open systems are not able to do that well.

# The Criminalization of P2P

 - The core innovation of the internet was P2P
 - P2P has become contraband.
 - Use by Thieves, Pirates and other criminals.
 - It is being engineered out of the Internet

# Venture Capitalism

 - Because of privileged access to accumulated wealth, Capitalists capture the wealth of the future by offering each generation of innovators chance to become a junior partner in their club, exchanging the future value of what they create for the present wealth they need to get started.

# Capturing the Future

 - The dead, stolen, value of the past captures the unborn value of the future.
 - If we are to have a free society modeled after peer networks, free software, gift economies and the pastoral commons, we need to find a way for innovation to be born free.

# Capital will Not Fund P2P

 - Capitalism requires enclosure, without privileged access to scarce resources, it can not capture profit.

# Capital will Not Fund P2P

 - If we can not find alternatives to Capitalist financing, it is not only the Internet as we know that we will lose, but also the chance to remake society in it's image.

# Goodbye and thanks for all the lulz

 - Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace by John Perry Barlow
 - "We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.‚Äù

# Goodbye and thanks for all the lulz

 - John Gilmore
 - "The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it."

# Goodbye and thanks for all the lulz

 - The critical feature of the Net that gave rise to such freedom was the mesh topology of the network and the distributed and peer-to-peer architecture of the applications that ran on it.

# Goodbye and thanks for all the lulz

 - Yet, capitalism wont fund mesh and peer to peer systems
 - The new era of freedom envisioned by Barbook, Barlow and Gimore can not exist on Facebook, and can not be funded by Capital
 
# Goodbye and thanks for all the lulz

 - The Internet as we knew it is essentially gone.
 - Commercialization has made your online rights irrelvant
 - We must look beyond the market

# We must assert our social aspirations

 - We can only solve this problem socially
 - We must assert our right to have collective social aspirations
 - We must collectively work towards these aspirations

# We must assert our social aspirations

 - Free and open communication platforms that don't surveil, control or exclude can only be provided socially, as a public good.
